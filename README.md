**'Physics Student'**

I'm an undergraduate Physics student and novice software developer trying to build up my knowledge one project at a time, I am about tying in my knowledge of technologies in Physics with trying to create interesting projects in as many different languages as I can! All the projects I make are built from an idea that I have found interesting or from some aspect of my life which I want to try and tie into this portfolio. I love seeing my ideas physically so am trying to implement more electronics into future projects, and hopefully document the process on here.
